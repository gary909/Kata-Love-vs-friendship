    <p>
        If a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 ... z = 26 <br>
        <br>
        Then l + o + v + e = 54<br>
        <br>
        and f + r + i + e + n + d + s + h + i + p = 108<br>
        <br>
        So friendship is twice as strong as love :-)<br>

        Your task is to write a function which calculates the value of a word based off <br>
        the sum of the alphabet positions of its characters.<br>
        <br>
        The input will always be made of only lowercase letters and will never be empty.<br>
